Capital Region Mesh is powered by volunteers, neighbors, and curious minds. Whether you're technical or not, there are many ways to help grow and strengthen the mesh.

### 🛠️ Host a Node
Set up a Meshtastic device in your home, vehicle, or backpack. Every node expands coverage and resilience.

### 📚 Share Knowledge
Write guides, record videos, or help others get started. Local documentation makes the network more accessible.

### 💬 Spread the Word
Tell friends, community groups, and emergency planners. Awareness builds adoption.

### 🧑‍💻 Contribute Code or Design
Help improve tools, scripts, or branding. Open-source contributions are always welcome.

### 🎁 Donate Gear
Have spare LoRa devices or parts? We can help redistribute them to new users in the region.

### 🤝 Collaborate
Join discussions, propose ideas, or help organize meetups. This is a living project — shaped by everyone who joins.

No contribution is too small. We will be rolling out detailed contribution workflows in the coming days. For now, the most impactful contribution you can make is to [join the network](../join/) and spread the word.
