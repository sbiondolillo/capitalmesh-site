title: "How Can I Contribute?"

Capital Region Mesh is built by volunteers, neighbors, and curious minds. Whether you're technical or not, there are many ways to help grow and strengthen the mesh.

### 🛠️ Host a Node
Place a Meshtastic device in your home, vehicle, or backpack. Every node expands coverage and resilience. Our [getting started guide](/join/#getting-started-is-easy) makes setup simple.

### 📚 Share Knowledge
Write guides, record videos, or help others get started. Local documentation makes the network more accessible. If you’ve created something helpful—tutorials, walkthroughs, printable flyers—[email us](mailto:info@capitalmesh.net) and we’ll feature it in our blog or newsletter.

### 💬 Spread the Word
Tell friends, community groups, and emergency planners. Awareness builds adoption. We’re especially looking for individuals or organizations who can offer access to towers, rooftops, or other high locations for hosting solar-powered nodes.

### 🧑‍💻 Contribute Code or Design
Improve tools, scripts, or branding. Open-source contributions are always welcome. This site’s source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sbiondolillo/capitalmesh-site)—Pull Requests are encouraged.

### 🎁 Donate Gear
Have spare LoRa devices or parts? We’ll help redistribute them to new users in the region—especially those with ideal hosting locations but limited funds or technical capacity. Where possible, we’ll facilitate direct transfers without taking possession ourselves.

### 🤝 Collaborate
Join discussions, propose ideas, or help organize meetups. This is a living project—shaped by everyone who joins.
