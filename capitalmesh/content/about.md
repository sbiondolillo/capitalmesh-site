**CapitalMesh is a non-commercial initiative focused on empowering local communities through decentralized connectivity.**

We believe in open-source collaboration, low-maintenance infrastructure, and community resilience. This project is built by and for the people of the Capital Region â€” with no ads, no monetization, and no gatekeeping.

This site is still under construction. More details coming soon.
