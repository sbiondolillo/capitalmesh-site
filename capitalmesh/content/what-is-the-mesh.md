title: "What is the Mesh?"
---

Meshtastic is an open-source, long-range mesh communication system that uses inexpensive LoRa radios to connect people without relying on cellular or internet infrastructure.

It’s designed for off-grid messaging, emergency preparedness, outdoor adventures, and community resilience. By forming a decentralized mesh network, Meshtastic devices relay messages across multiple nodes — extending coverage far beyond the range of a single device.

Whether you're hiking in remote areas, preparing for natural disasters, or building local networks for community empowerment, Meshtastic offers a flexible and privacy-respecting way to stay connected.

## 🧠 How It Works: From Spectrum to Mesh

Meshtastic builds on a stack of technologies that make long-range, low-power communication possible — even in places where traditional networks fail.

### 🌀 RF Spectrum

All wireless communication happens over the **radio frequency (RF) spectrum**, a range of electromagnetic waves used for everything from AM/FM radio to Wi-Fi and satellite links. Different parts of the spectrum are regulated and allocated for specific uses — some require licenses, others are open to the public.

### 🛠️ ISM Bands

Meshtastic operates in the **Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands**, which are unlicensed portions of the RF spectrum. These bands are globally available for low-power devices, making them ideal for community-driven communication. In the U.S., Meshtastic typically uses the 915 MHz ISM band; in Europe, it’s 868 MHz.

These bands are shared — meaning devices must play fair by using low power and short transmissions. That’s where LoRa comes in.

### 📶 LoRa: Long Range, Low Power

**LoRa** (short for Long Range) is a wireless modulation technique that enables communication over miles with minimal power. It’s not fast — you won’t stream video over LoRa — but it’s incredibly efficient for short messages, sensor data, and location updates.

LoRa’s magic lies in its ability to punch through obstacles and cover long distances, even in noisy environments. It’s perfect for rural areas, forests, mountains, or dense urban zones where traditional signals struggle.

### 🔗 Meshtastic: The Mesh Layer

Meshtastic takes LoRa and adds a mesh networking layer on top. Instead of each device talking directly to a central hub, nodes relay messages to each other — hopping across the network until the message reaches its destination.

This means:
- No single point of failure
- No need for internet or cell towers
- Coverage grows as more people join

Meshtastic devices can be handheld, solar-powered, or integrated into fixed installations. They’re affordable, customizable, and designed to empower local communication — whether you're off-grid or just building something resilient.
