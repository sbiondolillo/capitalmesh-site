title: "What is Meshtastic?"
---

Meshtastic is an open-source, long-range mesh communication system that uses inexpensive LoRa radios to connect people without relying on cellular or internet infrastructure.

It’s designed for off-grid messaging, emergency preparedness, outdoor adventures, and community resilience. By forming a decentralized mesh network, Meshtastic devices relay messages across multiple nodes — extending coverage far beyond the range of a single device.

Whether you're hiking in remote areas, preparing for natural disasters, or building local networks for community empowerment, Meshtastic offers a flexible and privacy-respecting way to stay connected.
