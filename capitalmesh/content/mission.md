title: "What is Capital Region Mesh?"
---

We are a non-commercial initiative focused on empowering local communities through decentralized connectivity. We use Meshtastic and LoRa technology to build off-grid mesh networks that prioritize resilience, privacy, and local autonomy.

## Our Mission

We aim to foster community-owned communication networks that thrive without centralized control. This means:

- Connectivity without gatekeepers
- Open-source tools and transparent practices
- Participation for everyone, regardless of technical background

## Why It Matters

Traditional infrastructure is fragile. CapitalMesh offers an alternative — one that works during outages, in remote areas, and for people who value independence. It’s about trust, empowerment, and connection.

## Built by the Capital Region

This project is built by and for the people of the Capital Region — with no ads, no monetization, and no gatekeeping. It’s a living experiment in community resilience.
