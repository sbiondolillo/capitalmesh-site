We aim to foster community-owned communication networks that thrive without centralized control. This means:

- Connectivity without gatekeepers
- Open-source tools and transparent practices
- Participation for everyone, regardless of technical background

## Why It Matters

Traditional infrastructure is fragile. CapitalMesh offers an alternative — one that works during outages, in remote areas, and for people who value independence. It’s about trust, empowerment, and connection.

## Built by the Capital Region

This project is built by and for the people of the Capital Region — with no ads and no monetization. It’s a living experiment in community resilience.
