## ✨ What to Expect

This will be another night of shared vision, practical planning, and community-scale coordination. We’ll build on ideas from [October’s Kick-Off](/blog/events/2025/kickoff-recap/), where we explored organizational structure, onboarding kits, and regional deployment strategy. This session will focus on refining configuration and identifying tangible action items for the winter season.

### Agenda
- **7:00–7:15** — Arrivals & Introductions  
- **7:15–7:45** — Regional Configuration Presentation  
- **7:45–8:15** — Q&A  
- **8:15–8:30** — Break / Open Discussion  
- **8:30–9:00** — Working Session

## 📋 Mesh Planning Priorities

We’ll walk through how to configure LoRa radios for local mesh resilience while maintaining links to the broader regional and statewide Meshtastic network. This includes results from November’s experiments and a proposed configuration for winter deployment.

The second half of the evening is hands-on: participants will help shape the deployment plan, suggest improvements, and take ownership of specific next steps. Whether you're bringing gear, ideas, or curiosity — your input matters.
