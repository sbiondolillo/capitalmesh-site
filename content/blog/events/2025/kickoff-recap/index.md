## 🧭 Organizational Planning & Feedback

After introductions, Sam presented a draft and request for comments outlining an aspirational structure for a mature Capital Region Mesh organization. The group offered thoughtful feedback, with a strong focus on how to onboard newcomers quickly and effectively.

One popular idea was the creation of **ready-made kits** — preconfigured hardware bundles that simplify setup and participation. This dovetailed nicely with one of the key [lessons from No Kings](/blog/lessons-from-no-kings/#takeaways), which emphasized outreach through specific use cases rather than abstract ideals. These are now a high priority item for the group going forward.

Participants also suggested establishing **weekly nets** to foster regular engagement, with some proposing a gamified format inspired by ham radio contesting or the streak mechanics seen in mobile apps like Duolingo.

## 🔧 Hardware Showcase — RPT Series Node Enclosure

After the Q&A, Bill shared his latest custom enclosure design for the RPT nodes — several of which are currently active as key components of New Hampshire's statewide Meshtastic network. The group gathered around the table to examine the build and discuss its evolution.
