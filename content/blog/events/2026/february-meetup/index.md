## ✨ What to Expect

Our February meetup continues the momentum from [January’s presentations](/blog/events/2026/january-meetup-recap/) and the community's shift towards MeshCore for reliable LoRa messaging. This month, we’re focusing on **practical approaches to more resilient regional communication** — from solar‑powered field nodes to structured PACE planning.

We’ll begin with two presentations, followed by a collaborative working session to review January’s progress and set priorities for the next development cycle.

### Agenda
- **7:00–7:15** — Arrivals & Introductions  
- **7:15–7:45** — *Design and Deployment of Solar Tree Nodes* — Presentation & Q&A  
- **7:45–8:15** — *Intro to PACE Plans* — Presentation & Q&A  
- **8:15–8:30** — Break / Open Discussion  
- **8:30–9:00** — Working Session: Review of January progress + planning for February

## 💡 Presentation Highlights

### 🌳 Design and Deployment of Solar Tree Nodes
Our first presenter will explore the design, power budget, and deployment considerations behind **solar‑powered “tree nodes”** — discreet, long‑duration outdoor installations that can extend mesh coverage without relying on grid power. We’ll discuss panel sizing, battery chemistry, mounting strategies, and how these nodes can support regional reliability goals.

### 🧭 Intro to PACE Plans
Next, we’ll examine **PACE planning** (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) as a structured approach to resilient communication. This session will cover how mesh radios fit into the PACE framework, how individuals and groups can build layered communication strategies, and how these principles can guide Capital Region Mesh’s long‑term goals.

## 🧩 Collaborative Working Session

The final portion of the evening is hands‑on and participatory. We’ll:

- Review January’s accomplishments  
- Assess the impact of the new MeshCore deployments on our bridge‑node design  
- Identify blockers, opportunities, and next steps  
- Adjust or form working groups for February’s development cycle  

Whether you’re contributing hardware, software, documentation, or simply curiosity, your presence helps shape the direction of **Capital Region Mesh**.
