## ✨ What to Expect

March’s meetup shifts toward the social and structural foundations of our work. We’ll begin with an accessible introduction to **mutual aid** — what it is, what it isn’t, and how its principles directly inform the way Capital Region Mesh organizes, collaborates, and builds.

We’ll then move into the technical heart of the evening: the **LoRa Strategy Working Group** [formed at last month's meetup](/blog/events/2026/february-meetup-recap/) will present their initial proposal for a coordinated regional deployment plan. This is the first concrete blueprint for how our LoRa layer will take shape across the Capital Region.

### Agenda
- **7:00–7:15** — Arrivals & Introductions  
- **7:15–7:45** — *What Is Mutual Aid?* — Presentation & Discussion  
- **7:45–8:00** — Break / Open Conversation  
- **8:00–8:30** — *LoRa Working Group: Initial Deployment Proposal* — Presentation & Q&A  
- **8:30–9:00** — Working Session: Feedback, priorities, and next steps for spring deployment

## 💡 Presentation Highlights

### 🤝 What Is Mutual Aid?
Our first presentation introduces the concept of **mutual aid** — a community‑driven approach to meeting shared needs through cooperation, solidarity, and distributed responsibility. We’ll explore how these principles map directly onto resilient communication networks, decentralized infrastructure, and the collaborative culture that CRM continues to build.

This session is designed for all experience levels and includes time for discussion and reflection.

### 📡 LoRa Deployment Strategy: First Draft
The LoRa Strategy Working Group will share their initial proposal for a coordinated regional deployment plan. Topics include:

- Recommended node types and placement patterns  
- Early coverage goals for spring and summer  
- Integration with MeshCore rooms and community workflows  
- Testing, validation, and maintenance considerations  
- Opportunities for volunteers to participate in field deployments  

This is the first public look at the roadmap that will guide our next several months of hands‑on work.

## 🧩 Collaborative Working Session

The final portion of the evening is dedicated to shaping the next phase of development. We’ll:

- Gather feedback on the LoRa proposal  
- Identify priority deployment sites for spring  
- Discuss resource needs, volunteer roles, and testing plans  
- Outline tasks for working groups and individual contributors  

Whether you’re interested in field deployments, documentation, hardware experimentation, or community outreach, there’s a place for you in this phase of the project.
