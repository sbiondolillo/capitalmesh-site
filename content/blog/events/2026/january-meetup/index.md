## ✨ What to Expect

We’re kicking off 2026 with an evening of shared learning and collaborative planning. This session builds on [December’s progress](/blog/events/2025/december-meetup-recap/) — including our decision to use the public LongFast configuration for the Backbone and the early work around the bridge‑node enclosure concept.

This month features two presentations exploring **alternative approaches to regional connectivity**, followed by a working session where we’ll review December’s accomplishments and set the direction for January’s development cycle.

### Agenda
- **7:00–7:15** — Arrivals & Introductions  
- **7:15–7:45** — *Using WireGuard to Build a Federated VPN Mesh* — Presentation & Q&A  
- **7:45–8:15** — *MeshCore as a Regional Messaging Platform* — Presentation & Q&A  
- **8:15–8:30** — Break / Open Discussion  
- **8:30–9:00** — Working Session: Review of December progress + planning for January

## 💡 Presentation Highlights

### 🛡️ Federated VPN Mesh with WireGuard
Our first presenter will explore how a distributed VPN mesh can enable secure, resilient links between individuals, home labs, and community services. We’ll look at federation models, routing considerations, and how this approach might integrate with the broader Capital Region Mesh ecosystem.

### 📡 MeshCore as an Alternative Protocol
Next, we’ll examine **MeshCore** — a protocol that may offer a more robust foundation for reliable regional messaging than adapting Meshtastic beyond its design scope. We’ll cover architecture, tradeoffs, and potential paths for future experimentation.

## 🧩 Collaborative Working Session

The final portion of the evening is hands‑on and participatory. We’ll:

- Review what we accomplished in December  
- Assess early progress on the bridge‑node enclosure  
- Identify blockers, opportunities, and next steps  
- Form or adjust working groups for January’s development cycle  

Whether you’re contributing hardware, software, documentation, or simply curiosity, your presence helps shape the direction of **Capital Region Mesh**.
