# Welcome to the CapitalMesh Voice Server

This service is intentionally **private** and only reachable through our private network.  
If you're seeing this page, you're **not currently connected** to the VPN.

## How to Join

1. **Request access** from a CapitalMesh admin  
2. Install the VPN app on your device  
3. Import the configuration file we provide  
4. Activate the VPN tunnel  
5. Connect to the Mumble server at: mumble.capitalmesh.net

Once your VPN tunnel is active, this hostname will resolve to the private server.

## Why We Use a VPN

- Keeps the voice server private  
- Prevents abuse and unauthorized access  
- Ensures low‑latency, encrypted communication  
- Allows us to maintain a trusted community environment
