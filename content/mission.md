## 🌱 Why Are We Building This?

The Capital Region Mesh is more than a tech project - it's a community effort to stay connected, informed, and resilient. Whether you're a hobbyist, a neighbor, or just curious, you're welcome here.

We believe everyone deserves a way to communicate that's free from corporate control, surveillance, and dependency on fragile infrastructure. That's why we’re building a decentralized mesh network - one that can work even when the internet doesn't.

## 💡 What Do We Stand For?

We aim to foster community-owned communication networks that thrive without centralized control. This means:

- **Connectivity without gatekeepers**  
  No cell towers, no subscriptions, no middlemen.

- **Open-source tools and transparent practices**  
  Built in the open, shared freely, and improved together.

- **Participation for everyone**  
  No technical background required - just curiosity and care.

## 🧭 Who Is This For?

- Neighbors who want to stay informed - even during power or internet outages  
- Organizers who need a private way to share updates  
- Curious minds who love tinkering and learning  
- Anyone who believes communication should be free and local

## 🔐 Why Does It Matter?

Traditional infrastructure is more fragile than most people realize. We’ve seen how quickly the internet or cell service can go down - during storms, outages, or emergencies. Capital Region Mesh offers an alternative: a way to stay connected even when those systems fail.

It’s about trust, empowerment, and connection.

We’re not selling anything. We’re building something - together.

## 🛠️ Who's Behind This?

This project was started by neighbors in the Capital Region of New Hampshire - and it’s growing through shared effort. There are no ads, no monetization, and no corporate sponsors. Just people helping people.

We’re exploring what’s possible when communities take communication into their own hands - and you’re invited to be part of it.

> **Built by the people - for the people.**
